# KS Daily Work

## Hello

Hi you awesome developer, thank you for being a Kondo Dev, as you already know we want to provide the best development experience to our clients and we proud about having you as a part of our team. To help you with your daily work we made this checklist for you to use as a boilerplate at your day.

## The reason

Our experience working with interantional clients and working remotely with them left us with some knowledge in how make their experience better everytime. Also being a remote service provider makes comunication a little more difficult so with this guideline we will help you as a KondoDev to be better, and will also help the user to feel more in touch with their Job.
